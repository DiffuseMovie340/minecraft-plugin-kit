Instructions:
Go to the "releases" section.
See if there are any available releases. 
The releases are the stable, tested versions of the plugins or mods.
Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that they're bug-free! All are encouraged to submit bug reports.

(Not reccomended) Download beta plugins with published code
If you want to try out some beta plugins that were published to the main repository, but not officially released, here are instructions:
Open the file you want as a "RAW" file
Right-click the page and save it with "Save as"
It would help a lot if you could submit a bug report or a feature request! Or comment that you think it's ready for publish.

Keep in mind bug reports and feature requests can be found in the "Issue templates" folder.
