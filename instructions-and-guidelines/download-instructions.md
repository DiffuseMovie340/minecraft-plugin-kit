Instructions: 
Go to the "releases" section. 
See if there are any available releases. 
The releases are the stable, tested versions of the plugins or mods. 
Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that they're bug-free! All are encouraged to submit bug reports.

(Not reccomended) Download beta plugins with published code:
Folder:
Use the green "Code" button in the main screen and download and extract the ZIP file or open and clone the repository with GitHub Desktop.
Single file:
Click on the file you want, and click the "Download" button on the right
**OR** Open the file you want as a "RAW" file and right-click the page and save it with "Save as".
It would help a lot if you could submit a bug report or a feature request! 
Or comment that you think it's ready for publish.

Keep in mind bug reports and feature requests can be found in the "Issue templates" folder.
