# minecraft-plugin-kit
Hello!
This repository will be for basic minecraft plugins. They could be minigames or other things to switch up your Minecraft experience.
This may only work with Minecraft:Java Edition.
You can run on a local server. Or, upload it onto a online server and play with friends!
Larger projects will be on their own repositories.
